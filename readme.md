## About
Traditional-or-simplified was built by [Nick Drewe](https://www.twitter.com/nickdrewe) to detect the Chinese character set of pages being published on [wethrift](https://www.wethrift.com) ([github](https://wethrift.github.io)) and [publishthis.email](https://www.publishthis.email).

This version of Traditional-or-simplified was modified by [mobo27] for better performance.
